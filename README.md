**DeCleanup Rewards** is a decentralized application (dApp) build on steller network and designed to:
a) **tokenize IRL impact created via global/local cleanup efforts**
b) **incentivize environmental actions via DeFi mechanics**. 
The platform promotes environmental stewardship globally, with plans to activate global/local communities and scale across multiple blockchain ecosystems.

## Uniqueness

**How DeCleanup dApp works**: Participants engage in cleanups, submit proof via photos, and earn dynamic NFTs that evolve based on their contributions. More details in our [Mirror Article](https://mirror.xyz/decleanupnet.eth/ZzncKRu-Q-leEZkQ48Txm-NQRxG_hH3V3wyHaYUKfYI).

**User-Centric Design & Functionality**: The DeCleanup dApp offers a seamless user experience with an intuitive interface, allowing individuals and communities to easily submit proof of cleanups and earn dynamic NFTs, reflecting real-world impact on-chain. The verification system ensures quick approval for rewards, making the process simple and efficient. 
More details in our [Guide](https://mirror.xyz/decleanupnet.eth/A5uzOpx9HUgXZEopCKUsbgffw9SajL4Q9eECgrguq-4).

**Gasless Approach**: We chose Arbitrum for its low gas fees, with only the first claim requiring gas payment, while the rest of the experience is gasless. This eliminates barriers to onboarding non-tech-savvy users into Web3, enhancing real-world impact - our key KPI. Gasless transactions make Web3 more accessible to everyday people.

**Contribution to Ecosystem Growth**: By integrating environmental action with blockchain technology, making it intuitive and practically gasless for the end user, DeCleanup boosts on-chain activity through introducing new wallets and increases community engagement.

**Innovation in Application**: DeCleanup tokenizes real-world impact, converting environmental efforts into on-chain assets, which can be recognized as valuable impact products in the broader blockchain ecosystem.

**Community Onchain Activation**: Gamification elements like leaderboards and challenges via [Guild XYZ](https://guild.xyz/decleanup-network) allow users to earn extra points and compete for top spots. High-ranking users make it to the whitelist, encouraging participation and collaboration within the network.

## dApp and Dynamic NFT Collection

![9 Levels NFTs](https://beige-defiant-spoonbill-537.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmZELVjF8H5VvG1BxhunXK4n6LuK17RBuis5yRepEqxARk)

The collection items have common traits that remain consistent with each NFT upgrade:
- **Category**: Cleanup Impact NFT
- **Type**: Dynamic
- **Impact**: Environmental

There are dynamic traits, which grow every three cleanups:
- **Rarity**: Common (1-3 cleanups), Rare (4-6 cleanups), Legendary (7-9 cleanups), Unique (10 cleanups)
- **Level**: Newbie (1-3 cleanups), Pro (4-6 cleanups), Hero (7-9 cleanups), Guardian (10 cleanups)

And dynamic traits which grow with every cleanup done:
- **Impact Value**: 1 (first cleanup) to 10 (last cleanup)
- **DCU Points**: 10 (first cleanup) to 100 (last cleanup)

While the first two categories of traits determine the general information required for this impact productâ€™s classification on the Impact Marketplace, the last categories are mainly dynamic traits, which will determine the rewards value via Impact Marketplace DeFi utility and will contribute for userâ€™s IRL impact rank.

## Partnerships and Community Activation

Initial community outreach was established by partnership proposals with the key networks such as GreenPill Network and ReFi DAO. [ReFi](https://x.com/refiphangan/status/1837797388368728419?s=61)
and GreenPill Phangan, in particular are active in the [Monthly Earth Day](https://x.com/highlyartistic/status/1837668300425429023?s=61) movement. The other ReFi node that is organizing cleanups is [ReFi Tulum](https://x.com/refitulum/status/1838290711961112606?s=61)
Additional partnerships with [Aqua Purge web3](https://x.com/aquapurgeweb3/status/1822565379593449715?s=61) have furthered our global reach. These communities organize regular cleanups and were the first we have targeted.
Recent community that joined the Network, [HEMJapan](https://x.com/hemjapan?s=21), impressed us with 12 new wallets applied with the proofs after their recent Monthly Earth Day [cleanup](https://x.com/hemjapan/status/1838096871035928649?s=61).
Moreover, we are establishing partnerships with like minded projects. As example, DeCleanup and [Cleanify](https://x.com/cleanify_vet?s=21) have a collaborative strategy to promote each other, motivating both communities to organize more cleanups, and providing additional incentives for them.
